# Frontend Test Status

Last updated: 2025-01-30

## Summary

- **Test framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Total test files**: 2
- **Current status**: 8 passing, 2 failing (outdated tests)
- **CI integration**: Not yet added

## Test Files

### 1. Login.test.jsx
- **Status**: ❌ **2 tests failing** (outdated expectations)
- **Issues**:
  - Expects "Admin:" and "Beware:" text that no longer exists
  - Expected demo credentials format changed (now has clickable buttons)
  - Component structure has changed since tests were written

- **Tests**:
  1. ✅ Renders login form with Swedish labels
  2. ❌ Shows demo credentials (expects old format)
  3. ✅ Calls login function when form submitted
  4. ✅ Shows error message when login fails
  5. ✅ Shows loading state during login

### 2. ReminderList.test.jsx
- **Status**: ❌ **2 tests failing** (mock expectations don't match implementation)
- **Issues**:
  - Tests expect API calls via `fetch`, but component may use localStorage in demo mode
  - Mock fetch expectations don't match actual API call patterns
  - Component behavior changed since tests were written

- **Tests**:
  1. ✅ Renders reminder list with Swedish title
  2. ❌ Fetches reminders on mount (mock expectation mismatch)
  3. ✅ Displays reminders when loaded
  4. ✅ Shows delete confirmation when delete button clicked
  5. ❌ Calls delete API when confirmation accepted (mock expectation mismatch)

## Issues Found

1. **Outdated test expectations**: Tests written for older component structure
   - Login component changed: demo credentials now in clickable buttons, not plain text
   - ReminderList may use localStorage in demo mode vs API calls

2. **Mock setup needs updating**:
   - Login test: Update expectations for demo credentials display
   - ReminderList test: Check if component uses localStorage or API, update mocks accordingly

3. **Component changes not reflected**:
   - Login: "Admin:" and "Beware:" labels removed/replaced
   - ReminderList: May have localStorage fallback for demo mode

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Quick Fix (For CI)
- Update failing tests to match current component structure
- Fix Login test demo credentials expectations
- Fix ReminderList mock expectations
- **Time**: ~30 minutes

### Option 2: Refactor Tests (Better Coverage)
- Rewrite tests to match current component behavior
- Add tests for demo mode (localStorage) vs API mode
- Add tests for new features (clickable demo buttons, etc.)
- **Time**: 2-3 hours

### Option 3: Skip Frontend Tests in CI (For Now)
- Keep tests for local development
- Don't add to CI until tests are updated
- **Time**: 0 minutes

## Running Tests

```bash
cd frontend

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test

# Run tests once
npm run test:run

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```

## Current Test Results

```
Test Files  1 failed | 1 passed (2)
Tests       2 failed | 8 passed (10)
```

## Next Steps

1. Decide: Fix now, refactor later, or skip for CI
2. If fixing: Update Login.test.jsx demo credentials expectations
3. If fixing: Update ReminderList.test.jsx mock expectations
4. If adding to CI: Add frontend test step after backend tests
