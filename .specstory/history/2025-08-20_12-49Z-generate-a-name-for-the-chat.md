I can see there's a JSON parsing error in your `package.json` file. The error message indicates there's an unexpected character after JSON at position 167, and it mentions there are duplicate JSON objects in the file. Let me examine the `package.json` file to identify and fix the issue.

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: frontend/package.json

I can see the issue! The `package.json` file contains two separate JSON objects concatenated together, which is invalid JSON syntax. There's a root-level package.json object followed by a frontend-specific package.json object. Let me fix this by keeping only the frontend-specific configuration:

Tool use: **edit_file**


<details><summary>Edit file: frontend/package.json</summary>

I will remove the duplicate JSON objects and keep only the frontend-specific package.json configuration

Perfect! I've fixed the JSON parsing error in your `package.json` file. The issue was that there were two separate JSON objects concatenated together:

1. A root-level package.json object with scripts for running frontend commands
2. The actual frontend package.json object with all the dependencies

I removed the duplicate root-level object and kept only the frontend-specific configuration. Now your `package.json` file contains valid JSON with:

- Project name: "mos"
- Vite scripts for development, build, lint, and preview
- React dependencies (React 19.1.1, React DOM, Bootstrap, React DatePicker)
- Development dependencies for ESLint, TypeScript types, and Vite

You should now be able to run `npm install` successfully in the frontend directory. The package.json file is now properly formatted as a single, valid JSON object.
